Digital AI Resume - Future of Career Conversation with AI Agent!

Excited to share a project I’ve been building as part of my Agentic AI training - a personal AI chatbot designed to represent me in digital conversations!

💡 What It Does
This chatbot acts as a digital resume, allowing recruiters and hiring managers to interact with an AI version of me. It’s preloaded with details from my LinkedIn profile and personal summary, enabling natural, conversational Q&A about my background and experience. If a question falls outside its knowledge base, it triggers a push notification to my phone, alerting me to update the database — helping the bot continuously learn from real-world conversations.

⚙️ How It Works (Behind the Scenes)

This AI agent brings together several intelligent components to simulate a real professional interaction:

📄 Reads my LinkedIn data and summary file for context.
🤖 Uses OpenAI’s GPT model to generate responses in my tone.
📲 Sends push notifications for unknown or new questions.
📧 Automatically records recruiter details and shares them instantly to me.
🔁 Improves continuously with every new conversation.

🧠 Tech Stack

⚙️ Python + OpenAI API
☁️ Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces
🔄 Logic for real-time updates and continuous learning

🌐 Potential Commercial Applications
Beyond personal branding, this system could automate:
🎟️ Ticket booking and reservations
🧑‍💻 IT support tasks (password resets, incident creation)
💬 Real-time customer service
🗣️ Automated feedback collection for businesses

This project marks a step toward integrating AI-driven agents into everyday professional and business workflows.
